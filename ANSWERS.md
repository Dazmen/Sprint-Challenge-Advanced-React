- [ ] Why would you use class component over function components (removing hooks from the question)?
    
    --The main thing that we loose out on when using class components over functional components (with hooks) is the lifecycle methods. Besides that it is more of preference. Both are important to know because there are a lot of code bases that are written with class components that we could be expected to work on in the future.

- [ ] Name three lifecycle methods and their purposes.

    --the three lifecycle methods are mounting, updating and unmounting (or life, growth, death) This is when the component first renders, then rerenders (due to new props or a change of state) and then when the component is unmounted.

- [ ] What is the purpose of a custom hook?

    --much like components, the purpose of custom hooks are to set up reusable stateful logic for clean/DRY code.

- [ ] Why is it important to test our apps?

    â€“ It is summed up with one thing. User Experience. As developers, our jobs will generally boil down to one of two things. Making the company money or saving it money. Testing helps smooth the process of integrating updates while also helping to ensure that the user experience is not adversely affected by a random bug that appears (which could result in a potential loss of a consumer).
